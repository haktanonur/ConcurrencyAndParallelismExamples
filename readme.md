# Java Concurrency & Parallelism Examples

This repository contains beginner-friendly Java code examples that demonstrate key concepts of **concurrency** and **parallelism**.  

The code is designed to accompany my [Medium articles](https://onurhaktan.medium.com/) where I explain these concepts through real-life analogies (a car repair shop).
